##Requirements

  * ansible > 1.6

Note: on ubuntu 14.04 you have to install ansible with `pip` rather than `apt-get`
or if you don't want to use `pip` to install system-wide commands, you can install ansible PPA

```
apt-get install python-software-properties
add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
apt-get update
apt-get install ansible
```
